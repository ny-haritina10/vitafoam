### Form sponge insertion
- purchase price (numeric)
- date creation (date)
- dimension
    . length (numeric)
    . width (numeric)
    . height (numeric)

### Form product insertion
- label (string)
- selling price (numeric)
- dimension
    . length (numeric)
    . width (numeric)
    . height (numeric)

### Sponge Transformation
- initial sponge (select)
- date transformation (date)
- input qtÃ© product (numeric)
    . loop trough all product
- remaining 
    . dimension
        . length (numeric)
        . width (numeric)
        . height (numeric)

### Stock Status
- product 
    -> stock status 
        -> prix de revient
        -> prix de vente 

- total sum products transformed
    -> total 
        -> getSellingPrice * quantity
        -> sum per initial sponge

- total amount for the most profitable product 
    -> get most profitable product 
        -> get max(rapport price/volume)
    -> get remaining dimension for each initial sponge 
    -> transform each reamining to the most profitable product
        -> transform until remaining is empty 
    -> total amount by selling price
        -> per initial sponge
        -> total 
    -> Profit from each product
        -> get initial sponge
        -> get cost price by m^3
        -> profit = selling - cost

- total amount for the least bulky product
    -> get the least bulky product 
    -> get min(volume)
    -> get remaining dimension for each initial sponge 
    -> transform each reamining to the the least bulky product
        -> transform until remaining is empty 
    -> total amount by selling price
        -> per initial sponge
        -> total 
    -> Profit from each product
        -> get initial sponge
        -> get cost price by m^3
        -> profit = selling - cost
