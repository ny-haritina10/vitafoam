Assuming i have those table, and i have a java model for each of them. Here is what i want to do, i want to calculate the purchase price for each InitialSponge, the calculation is based on the table CubicMeterFormula ... here is an example : 
. using cubic meter formula 
    - formula is: 1.5L of essence, 3kg of paper, 0.5kg hardener to produce 1m3 of InitialSponge (this formula is fix for each of InitialSponge)
    - exemple:
        -> 1.5L essence (PU = 2.000)
            -> 1.5 * 2000$
            -> 3000$
        -> 3kg papier (PU = 500)
            -> 3 * 500$
            -> 1500$
        -> 0.5KG durcisseur (PU = 1500)
            -> 0.5 * 1500$
            -> 750$
        ==> 3000 + 1500 + 750 = 5.250$ 
        ==> price per cubic meter = 1m3 is equal to 5.250$

        for example: 
        -> Bloc A 
            - volume = 450m3 (example)
            -> Purchase price Theorique: 450 * 5.250 = 2.362.500$
But here is the little constraint, lets assume that the unit price of the raw materiel is variable based on the date of purchase. So, when i calculate the price per cubic meter from the formula i need to look at the date_creation of the bloc, then get the unit price based on this date ... And the consumption of raw materials must be in FIFO.

First, i need you to tell me if you have understand the problem, then i want you to suggest me the most efficient approach to solve this problem in term of performance because i have a large amount of data to handle (1 million of lines) ... What is the most efficient approach ? process and do the calculations in Java or do them in the database with views or triggers or functions?


/*------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ */

Let me break down my understanding of your problem:

1. You need to calculate the purchase price of InitialSponge blocks based on:
   - A fixed formula from CubicMeterFormula that defines how much of each raw material is needed per cubic meter
   - The volume of the InitialSponge (calculated from dim_length * dim_width * dim_height)
   - The unit prices of raw materials, which vary over time (stored in RawMaterielPurchase)

2. Key Complexity: When calculating the price for an InitialSponge:
   - You need to look at its date_creation
   - Find the relevant raw material prices based on that date using FIFO logic
   - This means if you need 10L of essence and you have:
     * 5L purchased on Jan 1st at $2000
     * 8L purchased on Jan 5th at $2200
     * For a block created on Jan 7th needing 10L, you'd use:
       - 5L at $2000 (oldest stock)
       - 5L at $2200 (remaining from newer stock)

3. Scale: You're dealing with around 1 million records

For this scale and complexity, I would recommend a hybrid approach, but with the heavy lifting done in the database. Here's why:

1. Database-Side Benefits:
   - The database can optimize the FIFO calculations using indexes
   - Reduced data transfer between application and database
   - Easier to maintain data consistency
   - Can leverage database caching mechanisms
   - Complex calculations happen close to the data

2. Java-Side Implementation:
```java
public BigDecimal calculateSpongePrice(Long spongeId) {
    return jdbcTemplate.queryForObject(
        "SELECT calculate_sponge_purchase_price(?)", 
        BigDecimal.class, 
        spongeId
    );
}
```

3. Performance Optimizations:
   - Add indexes on relevant columns:
     ```sql
     CREATE INDEX idx_raw_materiel_purchase_date ON RawMaterielPurchase(date_purchase);
     CREATE INDEX idx_raw_materiel_purchase_material ON RawMaterielPurchase(id_raw_materiel);
     ```
   - The FIFO calculation uses a recursive CTE for efficient stock allocation
   - Results can be cached at the application level if needed

4. Additional Recommendations:
   - Batch process calculations when possible
   - Consider materializing some intermediate results if calculations are not real-time
   - Add error handling for cases like insufficient stock
   - Consider adding a price history table to cache calculations
